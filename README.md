About StartBox
=============
An incredibly powerful theme framework for WordPress. Official website: (http://wpstartbox.com).

Installation
-----------
[Important:] You can download a .zip archive using the Repository Download button above, but make sure you rename the resulting folder to "startbox" (it will default to "StartBox-master"). If you forget to rename the folder, weird things may happen.

StartBox can be installed like any other WordPress theme, either via the built-in Theme Uploader, or by manually uploading to your server it via (s)FTP.

Usage
-----
We highly recommend that you use a Child Theme instead of running StartBox directly. We've created a pretty simple one for you to modify and destry here: (https://github.com/WebDevStudios/StartBox-Child)

If you're looking for a more high-caliber design, we recommend one from (http://wpstartbox.com/themes/).
