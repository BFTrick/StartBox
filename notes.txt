#### From the forum
	In the sb_next_post_link and sb_previous_post_link filters, I don't think there's a way to filter in arguments for the in_same_cat or excluded_categories options if the default function (http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/next_post_link)
	Chad Warner asked about using in_same_cat on the forums and I ended up having him turn off the default before/after post nav and just use the WP functions in single.php.
	So support for that in the filter would be cool. I didn't even know about the in_same_cat argument until he mentioned it. Would have been useful more than once in the past...
